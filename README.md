# Admission-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses data-driven approaches to predict the probability of a student’s admission to a university based on various academic and profile factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP/LOR ratings, and university ranking.

📊 Project Overview
The goal is to demonstrate the use of Business Analytics and Machine Learning techniques for predictive modeling. By analyzing historical admissions data, the model estimates the likelihood of admission for new applicants.

🔍 Features
Data loading and preprocessing using pandas and numpy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using matplotlib

Predictive modeling (e.g., Linear Regression or other ML models)

Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (R² Score, MSE, etc.)

Insights to support data-driven decision-making in the education sector

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

GRE Score

TOEFL Score

University Rating

Statement of Purpose (SOP) Strength

Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Strength

CGPA

Research Experience

Target: Chance of Admission

🧪 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (if used for modeling)
